# **Feature Engineering** 

## Feature Engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract feature from raw data. these feature can be used to improve performance of Machine Learning Algorithms. 

### This consist of the following techniques.
  
  > Feature Transformation
  
   - Missing Values
   - Handling Categorical Features
   - Outlier Detection
   - Feature Scaling

  > Feature Construction

  > Feature Selection
  
  > Feature Extraction
