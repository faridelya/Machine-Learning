###  > Feature Engineering
Feature Engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract feature from raw data. these feature can be used to improve performance of Machine Learning Algorithms.
This consist of the following techniques.
- Feature Transformation

 - Missing Values
 - Handling Categorical Features
 - Outlier Detection
 - Feature Scaling
 - Feature Construction

> Feature Selection

>Feature Extraction
